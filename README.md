# BusPeakPeriods
To illustrate the daily volume of passengers on buses in Singapore so that commuters can plan a comfortable commute.

Motivation: During peak periods, buses get too full to the point where drivers just skip a stop. This project aims to educate commuters about timings when buses are extremely packed (little to no standing space) so that they may plan their commute better.

Tools we are going to be using:
1. Python
2. Visual Studio Code
3. Git
4. LTA DataMall API
5. Google, our saviour 



============
Day One:

Learning lessons:
1. I forced push my local repo to Github without pulling my existing README first, so its lost. This is my second attempt at a README.
2. Requests has two parameters that is useful in this case, params and headers.

To do:
1. Extract data from API JSON response
2. Figure how to extract all BusNo data using BusStopNo
